			<p>Dear instructors,</p>
		</div>
			<p>This letter is a sincere token of gratitude to teachers. Those who guide us through some of the most chaotic times of our lives.<br> We want to remind you how much of an impact you can have, not just on each student you teach, but as a profession and a community beyond the four walls of a classroom. Enjoy this collection of thank you notes from students to teachers who were integral in course of their lives.</p>
			
			<p>Thank you for your love, care, admonishment and disciplined culture that you taught me. It really went a long way in defining me today.Now i can produly say that i have the following skills:
				<ul>
					<li><b>Transformational leadership</b></li>
					<li><b>Project management.</b></li>
					<li><b>Design thinking.</b></li>
				
				</ul>

			</p>
			<p>I had so many dreams, and I don’t think I could have accomplished any of them without your example. You changed the way I thought about life and about learning. Now I know that I’m capable of anything with enough dedication and hard work.
Once again thank you for being our guide and beacon of hope.</p>
			<p>Thank you!</p><br>
